# PP3_1SwapInt
Clone this file and open it in IntelliJ.

You will only need to work in the src file swapInt.
Method checkSwap() needs to be completed.  Write sufficient code so that when two ints are read, they are swapped if the
first one is greater than the second one.

To turn in, show me on your laptop the results when you run swapIntTest().
